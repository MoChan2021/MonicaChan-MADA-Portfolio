Hi there, I'm Monica Chan. I'm a ~~_part-time_~~ 2^nd^ year PhD Environmental Health Science student in the College of Public Health.

When I'm not ~~mentally exhausting myself~~ learning, I'm a research microbiologist at the CDC in Atlanta, GA.  
![Your ~~weirdo~~ Agency Researchers](https://github.com/MoChan2021/MonicaChan-MADA-portfolio/blob/main/docs/2021.08.23_Edit_CEMB.PNG?raw=true)

### **Background & Training**
I've been around for a bit trying a bit of this and that.  

* **B.S.**: _Environmental Health_ (SMITH, BLACK, & NAHER)  
Animal Modeling, Developmental Tox, Environmental (aquatic) Tox evaluations
* **Private Industry**: _Occupational Health and Safety Analyst_
* **M.S.**: _Environmental Health_ (SMITH, LIPP, & LU)  
Prevalence of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ in domestic environments in GA.  
Food science, Quality Control, Pregnancy Health, Developmental Tox.
* **Fellowship**: _ORISE Fellow_   
Built-environment (healthcare settings), composite sample approaches & swab-to-sequencer workflow development and validation.
* **Ph.D.**: _Environmental Health_ (GLENN)  
Environmental Sample enhancement techniques for integration into swab-to-sequencer methods (MinION sequencing)
* **Government Agency**: _Microbiologist_
All of the previous and whatever the Agency's needs are. (COVID Response)

### **Research Interests**

* Improving environmental sampling methods 
* Developing a work process for field sampling directly going into molecular workflows, including sequencing and identification
* Developing approaches to enhance low-quality samples
* Equating recovered gnomic copies to CFU.

### **Statistics, Programming, Data Analysis Exp**

I have the basics that come with my academic history--STAT, BIOS, & EPID.  
The FANR class about Experimental Design has probably lasted the most with me. So I am familiar with the basics of R.  
My recent work history has had me playing with ggplot so I can make figures.  
In the before COVID times I attended several GATech's ABiL training and learned Linux and Python. Now due to COVID and pivot of work I have had zero practice and can't remember a darn thing about them.  

I maybe a bit of a data enthusiast-- I guess something fun I've started playing with is pivot charts in excel and applying them to my random logs I keep. Here's one of them:

### **Goals for the Course**

1. How to use modern coding and analysis tools to obtain, organize and process data for detailed analysis. 
2. Further develop skills to critically assess data and data analyses. (For self and others)
3. Utilize the developed skills and update/upgrade how microbiologists can present their data.
* **BONUS:** Code a little more elegantly and force myself to get in some quality practice with programming and data analysis

### **Fun Fact**

I owe a lot to this weird cellulose sponge-on-a-stick sampling device (aptly named, 3M SpongeStick). This tool has been a mainstay of nearly 1/3^rd^ of my life. Though I don't use the cellulose kind, I'm currently seeking macrofoam sticks as replacements to put into a molecular workflow. Alas, I will always hold a soft-spot for this tool, so effective at its job!

**BONUS FACT** (not work related)  
When I was an undergrad I had a choice to be an CPH or CASE graduate.

### **Link OUT: Predatory Journals**

I present to you all a fascinating paper:

[What's the Deal With Birds?](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/sillymolecules/birds.pdf) 

If you don't know what this paper is about it was "published" in the _Scientific Journal of Research and Reviews_ last year. If you read it, you can see that it is rather unusual.  
If you haven't had experience yet, this journal is an example of a Predatory journal. These "journals" are a common scam in academic fields. Typically they work by soliciting manuscript submissions, charge authors with a fee, and "publish" skipping the typical quality checks and rigor of peer review. 
Alas, the publisher has redirected the direct link of the paper to the [publisher's site](http://irispublishers.com/sjrr/pdf/SJRR.MS.ID.000540.pdf) once the message got out.

TLDR?  
This was published somewhere:  
![birbs](https://github.com/MoChan2021/MonicaChan-MADA-portfolio/blob/main/docs/2021.08.23_Birbs.PNG?raw=true)

If this is the quality of work that's coming from that publisher, you want to make sure you don't cite them or publish there.
