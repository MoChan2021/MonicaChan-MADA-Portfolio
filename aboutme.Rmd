### **Fun Fact**



### **Link Out: Predatory Journals**

I present to you all a fascinating paper:

[What's the Deal With Birds?](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/sillymolecules/birds.pdf) 

If you don't know what this paper is about it was "published" in the _Scientific Journal of Research and Reviews_ last year. If you read it, you can see that it is rather unusual.  
If you haven't had experience yet, this journal is an example of a Predatory journal. These "journals" are a common scam in academic fields. Typically they work by soliciting manuscript submissions, charge authors with a fee, and "publish" skipping the typical quality checks and rigor of peer review. 
Alas, the publisher has redirected the direct link of the paper to the [publisher's site](http://irispublishers.com/sjrr/pdf/SJRR.MS.ID.000540.pdf) once the message got out.

TLDR?  
This was published somewhere:
