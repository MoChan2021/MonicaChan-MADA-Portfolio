# Welcome to my **2021 MADA Data Analysis Portfolio**

### This website has been created as a data analysis portfolio for the Fall 2021 Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA) Course.

* Please use the `Menu Bar` above to look around.
  * `About Me` contains a blurb about myself and exists as a way to test out using the language of R.
  * `Projects` includes exercises completed as part of the MADA course and requirements.
  * `Additional Assessments` contains assessments and links to assessments for re-assessment purposes.

I look forward to learning and developing this site with you all!
