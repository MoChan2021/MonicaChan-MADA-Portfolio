# Source Target Visualization and Data

FiveThirtyEight's Article: ["How Americans View Biden's Response To The Coronavirus Crisis"](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/) 

* Specifically the Covid Infection Concern of the US.

Data accessible from button below the graphic. ["HERE"](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/covid-19-polls/archive/master.zip)   

# Data wrangling in R

## Loading libraries:
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(readr)
```
## Import CSV files from FiveThirtyEight and make into objectes:

```{r}
CovidConcern<- read_csv("docs/data/covid-19-polls-master/covid_concern_polls.csv")
summary(CovidConcern)

```
## Covid Concern Data
Selected data. set end_date as x axis. Plot points for each concern level

```{r warning=FALSE}
ConcernedDots<-CovidConcern%>%
  select(end_date, very, somewhat, not_very, not_at_all)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=end_date))+
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = c("0","25","50"))+
  geom_jitter(aes(y=very), color="red", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_jitter(aes(y=somewhat), color="orange", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_jitter(aes(y=not_very), color="blue", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_jitter(aes(y=not_at_all), color="purple", alpha=1/10)

```

Add lines? Try stat_smooth
```{r warning=FALSE}
CovidConcern%>%
  select(end_date, very, somewhat, not_very, not_at_all)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=end_date))+
  geom_point(aes(y=very), color="red", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_point(aes(y=somewhat), color="orange", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_point(aes(y=not_very), color="blue", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_point(aes(y=not_at_all), color="purple", alpha=1/10)+
  stat_smooth(aes(y=very), color="red",method = "lm")+
  stat_smooth(aes(y=somewhat), color="orange",method = "lm")+
  stat_smooth(aes(y=not_very), color="blue",method = "lm")+
  stat_smooth(aes(y=not_at_all), color="purple",method = "lm")

```

Not the right lines... Try adjusting axis scales and then mean lines?
Try using stat_summary to get means.
```{r warning=FALSE}
Viz.Fig<-CovidConcern%>%
  select(end_date, very, somewhat, not_very, not_at_all)%>%
  filter(end_date>"2020-03-01", end_date<"2021-04-01", very<"50")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=end_date))+
  geom_point(aes(y=very), color="red", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_point(aes(y=somewhat), color="orange", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_point(aes(y=not_very), color="blue", alpha=1/10)+
  geom_point(aes(y=not_at_all), color="purple", alpha=1/10)+
  labs(title = "How worried are Americans about infection?", subtitle = "How concerned Americans say they are that they, someone in their family or someone else \n they know will become infected with the coronavirus")+
  theme(axis.title.x= element_blank(), axis.title.y= element_blank())+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,25,50), labels = function(x) paste0(x * 1, '%'))+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%m/%d")+
  stat_summary(aes(y=very),fun="mean", color="red", geom="line", size=1)+
  stat_summary(aes(y=somewhat),fun="mean", color="orange", geom="line", size=1)+
  stat_summary(aes(y=not_very),fun="mean", color="blue", geom="line", size=1)+
  stat_summary(aes(y=not_at_all),fun="mean", color="purple", geom="line", size=1)

print(Viz.Fig)
```

Close!
But still not as clean as the original graphic.
Also not clear on how to add a legend for the lines...Lines are still a mess and too detailed.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

## Incorporating Feedback

Submitted to the Slack and got feedback by Dr. Handel and Dawson Dobash:

* smoothing lines, try loess curve
* try for figures with labels on other side, should be able to specify the location.
* center and break up title and subtitle
* color match graphic lines.

```

NOTE:

* geom_smooth was too smooth.
* utilized geom_quantile and adjusted quantiles to show only 1 line and changed the lambda values.
* color matched the lines with some ["predefined R colors"](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour).

## Adding Lables on the graphic

* Looked at Morgan Taylor's visualization code for example.

Interesting the resulting labels have odd color choices, half of them are correct the other... not so much.

### Concluding thoughts

The data is all there and the dotplot wasn't too difficult. I need more clues on what kind of smoothing was applied to the lines. There are certain trends that are visable from my reproduction but it's not exact.

There are some additional quick aesthetic choices I think I could have made, but I wasn't prioritizing them as much as more of the overall look of the graphic. 

I enjoyed learning about annotating and appreciate the direction my peers gave me to look into the annotation ability. I knew there was within R's capabilities but never tried using it as it seemed very complicated. I've got a bit of ways to go when it comes to really cleaning up the graphics but I also got to learn about how to utilize dates in ggplot. This will be useful in helping some of my peers when they do persistence studies and can utilize their summarized experimental run data to plug into something.
